Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to set up a WordPress with Docker and CD/CI
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the WAAW Gallery, always looking for artists to exhibit
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... nothing at the moment
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything and especially accessibility
